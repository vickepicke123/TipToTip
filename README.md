# TipToTip
A map of Luds whole trip (Open Map Maker)  
Each pin is either a location that I have verified that Lud and Michael were at from watching the series, or a pin used for drawing the path correctly.

Open the file in https://open-map-maker.vercel.app/map  
The file is large and it will likely take a while to load.

## Important
Simply open the file as a text document if you are worried about it's validity.  
Be careful not to click anywhere and only drag the map.  
I suggest selecting the 'Add Or Remove Control Points' tool (3rd one) so that the site does not need to load for ages if the map is clicked.
